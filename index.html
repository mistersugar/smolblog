			 <p>Back from the beach, where I celebrated my birthday with family and friends, read a couple of books, and relaxed. This morning I was back on the pitch to play pickup soccer with the guys. Warm spring morning with so much pollen that my eyes burned. Felt good to run and pass and shoot.</p>

			 <p>Now that I have a new brand for Zuiker Chronicles, I&rsquo;m working on incorporating the logo, colors, and fonts into the site. First step was to update my offsite personal about/profile at <a href="https://antonzuiker.com">antonzuiker.com</a>, where I&rsquo;ll keep a Now section (removing it from the Chronicles blog).</p>

			 <p>Today&rsquo;s news cycle has included quite a few articles (like <a href="https://wapo.st/4dK01kt">this</a> from WaPo) about the Trump rally that was interrupted as a couple of attendees passed out. The reports focus on the seemingly bizarre behavior of the candidate, who played deejay and &ldquo;swayed and bopped&rdquo; on stage for nearly 45 minutes.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite against Trump and the Republican Party this election, but I didn&rsquo;t immediately smirk at this. Something that happened near me recently made me pause and consider the room, so to speak.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://smol.zuiker.com/2024/10/13/more-enjoyable-live.html">other night</a> at the Cat&rsquo;s Cradle Back Room, as the Wildmans played, I noticed I was smiling, feeling happy and relaxed and delighted by the beautiful song by this young sister and brother.</p>
<p>But then, a woman in the back of the room suddenly yelled out, three times, and dropped to the concrete floor. People around me looked around in confusion, a man knelt beside the woman, the bartender grabbed a phone to call 911.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is everyone ok?&rdquo; asked Aila once her song was finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied a few people.</p>
<p>But the woman was conscious and being attended to, and people in the front weren&rsquo;t quite aware of what was going on. So Aila looked at her brother, Elisha, and together they said, OK, we&rsquo;ll play a song to help the mood, and they launched into a jiggy Appalachian fiddle tune. I was struck by how well they handled the disruption and used their music to lift up the mood.</p>
<p>But I found myself rattled, so I walked to the corner of the room and leaned against the wall. A song or two later, I returned to my spot in the middle of the floor. The woman who&rsquo;d fallen was gone—I don&rsquo;t know what happened to her—Aila was singing a covers of These Days and Fade Into You, and the energy of the room was back in the happy frequency.</p>
<p>I guess I just wanted to share my awareness of the energies and emotions that can flow through a crowd. When this incident happened, I marveled at how social we humans are. How connected we are. How quick our concern for another spreads, how swift we are to help the individual and the community.</p>
<p>I know who I&rsquo;m voting for this election (I hope to celebrate President Harris). The people at that Trump rally don&rsquo;t share a lot of my views, but for a moment some of the surely felt what I felt. That&rsquo;s a connection on which we can build.</p>

			 <p>Right about now, on the other side of the planet from where I&rsquo;m sitting (Chapel Hill, North Carolina, U.S.A.), <strong>Mereva Timante</strong> is getting married in Port Vila, the capital of the Republic of Vanuatu.</p>
<p>Mereva was just a small child of 2 when Erin and I arrived on the island of Paama as U.S. Peace Corps Volunteers in 1997. Her father and mother, Noel and Leah, hosted us during the two-month training period and then, when we returned to Liro Village as our assignment, they became our constant friends and teachers. They were our family, and Mereva was with us every single day. Ennah and Terry, too. They filled our two years in Vanuatu with much joy, and we cried when it was time for us to <a href="http://mistersugar.com/2000/03/01/from-there-to-here">go home to the States</a>.</p>
<p>Two decades later, though, Erin and I took our own children to Paama <a href="http://zuiker.com/a-return-to-paama">In 2018</a>. Leah and Mereva were there to welcome us, and we saw Terry and more of the clan in Vila. Our time in Vanuatu was much too short.</p>
<p>In the years since, we&rsquo;ve tried to make up for the distance by sending money to support Mereva in her studies. When we learned last month that she was to be married in October, we even talked about me flying back there for the celebration. Alas, that wasn&rsquo;t possible.</p>
<p>But if I couldn&rsquo;t get to Vanuatu for the wedding, where I&rsquo;d surely have been offered a ceremonial shell of kava, I knew that I could get to <a href="https://www.dakineskava.com">Da Kine&rsquo;s Kava</a> in Durham to have a cup of Vanuatu kava in honor of Mereva. &ldquo;Tahosis vareis,&rdquo; I said as I raised the cup to my ni-Vanuatu family. Well done, and I will see you soon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What was next? “We got our orders, and we are ready to fight and diminish Hamas and exterminate them wherever they are,” Hiram said. “Exterminate,” in reference to a small territory crowded with civilians who had nowhere to go, was as jolting as “Einsatzgruppen.”</p>

			 <p>On my lunch break in Durham today, I went to the post office to mail our tax info to the accountant, then walked to a small coffee shop I&rsquo;ve not yet visited, <a href="https://www.everloucoffee.com">EverLou</a>. The coffee was good, and served in a proper mug. I enjoyed it at an outdoor table, rereading <a href="https://simplebits.shop/collections/books/products/twenty-bits-fonts">Twenty Bits I Learned About Making Fonts Book</a> by designer Dan Cederholm.</p>
<p>I like Dan&rsquo;s style, so I subscribed to his new <a href="https://simplebits.com/2024/02/13/stc.html">Simple Type Club</a>. As part of that, I got a bundle of his typefaces, and Free Lunch is perfect for a new logomark for The Long Table, that people+meal+conversation project that has been dormant but not forgotten. I recently found new inspiration for the project, from conversations with my career coach and also that pile of lumber out back (milled from white oak trees in 2019).</p>
<p>Coffee and reading finished, I stopped into <a href="https://indyweek.com/food-and-drink/at-chibangas-neighborhood-market-durham-staples-fill-the-shelves/">Chibanga&rsquo;s Neighborhood Market</a>, a bodega next to Everlou. Paying for my sandwich, I asked about the store&rsquo;s name. Everything in Durham is named bull this, bull that, owner Marcus Morrow told me. So he and his partner named the store for matador Ricardo Chibanga (yes,a bullfighter).</p>
<p>Then I was back to the office and more work.</p>

			 <p>Before: The <a href="https://smol.zuiker.com/2019/04/20/the-blackjack-oak.html">photo</a> I posted to Micro.blog in 2019 of the blackjack oak on the mobile sawmill. The slabs from that day dried for more than 3 years, then went to the cabinet maker working on our new house.</p>
<p>After: The cabinet maker crafted this table for the dining room. We&rsquo;re very happy at the result and looking forward to many meals, drinks, and conversations with family, friends, and strangers.</p>

			 <p><strong>Richard Gildenmeister</strong> died this month at age 88 (<a href="https://www.brown-forward.com/obituary/Richard-Gildenmeister">obituary here</a>). He was a legendary bookseller in Cleveland for 55 years, and my friend for 20 years. There are plenty of mentions of him in my <a href="http://mistersugar.com/index.php?q=gildenmeister">blog archives</a>, including the story of our trip to New York City and the day we spent with architect Philip Johnson at The Glass House.</p>
<p>I found an audio recording of a conversation he and I had in 2011 when I was up in Cleveland for Thanksgiving, and another audio clip of his answering machine message, and I&rsquo;ve put them together into this Coconut Wireless microcast. It was an honor to know Richard.</p>

Now that I have the means to post audio observations, I&rsquo;ve decided to recycle the name for my microcasts.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve been back from our epic South Pacific trip for nearly two months, and only now am I getting a chance to log the various sound recordings I made during our week in Vanuatu. I hope to stitch together the best of the sounds and interviews into an audio postcard. Here, though, is one full clip of my interview with my son, Oliver, on the morning we first woke up at Erakor Island Resort in Port Vila, the capital of Vanuatu.</p>
